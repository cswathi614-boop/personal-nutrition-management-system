# personal-nutrition-management-system
This is a recreated version of the Personal Nutrition Management System developed as part of my academic learning. The project was rebuilt to improve my understanding of nutrition-based system design, user data handling, and application flow. It focuses on core functionalities like nutrition tracking and basic diet recommendations.
